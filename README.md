# GraphQL of Thrones
A Game of Thrones API
## About
There's a wonderful A Song of Ice and Fire API, but no (up-to-date) API for Game of Thrones. I set out to create my own using GraphQL. This is a labor of love and a WIP (mostly on weekends), so feel free to contribute. All data is sourced from the [Game of Thrones Wiki](https://gameofthrones.wikia.com)
### Infrastructure
* AWS Lambda
* AWS API Gateway
* Postgress
* Express/Node.js/GraphQL Express

### API
You can access the API [here](https://api.gothrones.show/?graphiql=true) and the documentation [here](http://gothrones.show).

## Support
As I mentioned above, this is a labor of love. ASoIaF & GoT are some of my favorite epic fantasies. If you feel like throwing some ETH my way to help support this project my address is:
